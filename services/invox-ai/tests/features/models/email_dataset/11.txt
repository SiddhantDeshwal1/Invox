Subject: Important: Update to our Remote Work Policy

Dear Employees,

This email is to inform you of an update to the company's Remote Work Policy, which will take effect starting March 1, 2026.

The revised policy includes new guidelines on flexible working hours and equipment reimbursement. The full policy document can be found on the company intranet under HR Documents.

We believe these changes will provide greater flexibility and support for our remote team members.

Thank you,

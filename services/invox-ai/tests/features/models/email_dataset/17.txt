Subject: Important Tax Document Available

Dear Peter Quinn,

Your 2025 tax statement, Form 1099-INT, is now available in your online account. This form reports interest income paid to you during the tax year.

You will need this document to prepare and file your annual income tax returns. Please download it from the 'Documents' section of your account portal.

If you have elected for paper delivery, a copy will be sent to your mailing address on file.

Sincerely,
National Finance Corp.

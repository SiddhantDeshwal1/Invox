Subject: Support Ticket #78-9521: Unable to access shared drive

Dear IT Support Team,

I am writing to report an issue with accessing the 'Marketing' shared drive. When I try to connect, I receive a 'Permission Denied' error message. This started happening this morning.

My username is 'jack.lee' and my operating system is Windows 11.

Could you please investigate this issue at your earliest convenience?

Thank you,
Jack Lee
Marketing Specialist

Subject: Following up on the Senior Marketing Analyst Offer

Dear Ms. Chen,

Thank you very much for offering me the Senior Marketing Analyst position. I am very excited about the opportunity to join the team at DigitalPulse Marketing.

After reviewing the offer, I would like to discuss the proposed base salary. Considering my 8 years of experience in data-driven marketing and the current market rates for this role in our region, I was hoping we could consider a figure closer to $95,000.

I am confident that my expertise in market segmentation and campaign analytics will deliver significant value. I am flexible and open to finding a compensation package that is fair for both of us.

Thank you for your consideration.

Warmly,
Fiona Garcia

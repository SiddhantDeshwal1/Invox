Subject: Freelance Writing Opportunity - Tech Blog

Hi Ethan Foster,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Grace, and I'm the content manager for "The Digital Frontier" blog. I've been following your articles on AI and machine learning and am a big fan of your clear and insightful writing style.

We are looking for a freelance writer to contribute a series of four in-depth articles on the future of AI. If you're interested, I'd love to discuss the topics and our rates.

Let me know if this sounds like a good fit for you.

All the best,
Grace Kim

Dear Michael Chang,

I am writing to provide you with an important update regarding Research in the Education sector. We have recently reviewed our policies and have made some significant changes that may affect you.

Specifically, the new guidelines for Research require all participants to re-submit their documentation by the end of the month. This ensures that we remain compliant with the latest industry standards.

We understand that this may cause some inconvenience, but it is a necessary step to ensure the integrity of our Education operations.

We value your feedback and would appreciate it if you could take a moment to complete our brief customer satisfaction survey.

Please note that due to recent policy updates, some of the standard procedures for Research in Education might have changed slightly since your last interaction.

To ensure compliance with international regulations, we have updated our terms of service regarding this matter.

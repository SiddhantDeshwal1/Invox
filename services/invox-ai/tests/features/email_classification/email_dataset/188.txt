Dear Margaret Martin,

I am writing to provide you with an important update regarding Legal & Civic in the Extra sector. We have recently reviewed our policies and have made some significant changes that may affect you.

Specifically, the new guidelines for Legal & Civic require all participants to re-submit their documentation by the end of the month. This ensures that we remain compliant with the latest industry standards.

We understand that this may cause some inconvenience, but it is a necessary step to ensure the integrity of our Extra operations.

Additionally, we have attached a detailed PDF guide that explains the new Legal & Civic in Extra features in depth.

We look forward to continuing our partnership and assisting you with any future requirements you may have.

Thank you for your continued trust in our services; we strive to improve our systems daily to better serve your needs.

In the event of any discrepancies, please report them within 24 hours so that we can launch an immediate investigation.

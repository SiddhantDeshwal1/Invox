We understand that this may cause some inconvenience, but it is a necessary step to ensure the integrity of our Promotions operations.

Your satisfaction is our top priority, and we appreciate your patience as we resolve these matters.

We highly recommend that you save a copy of this correspondence for your personal records, as it contains important reference numbers.

Our records indicate that your account is in good standing, but we recommend a periodic review of your settings.

In the event of any discrepancies, please report them within 24 hours so that we can launch an immediate investigation.

To ensure compliance with international regulations, we have updated our terms of service regarding this matter.

We are committed to transparency and will keep you informed of any further developments regarding this case.

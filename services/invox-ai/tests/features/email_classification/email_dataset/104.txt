Dear Michael Chang,

I am writing to provide you with an important update regarding Family & Pets in the Extra sector. We have recently reviewed our policies and have made some significant changes that may affect you.

Specifically, the new guidelines for Family & Pets require all participants to re-submit their documentation by the end of the month. This ensures that we remain compliant with the latest industry standards.

We understand that this may cause some inconvenience, but it is a necessary step to ensure the integrity of our Extra operations.

Please note that due to recent policy updates, some of the standard procedures for Family & Pets in Extra might have changed slightly since your last interaction.

We highly recommend that you save a copy of this correspondence for your personal records, as it contains important reference numbers.

Our team has been working tirelessly to ensure that all processes related to Family & Pets in Extra are streamlined for your convenience and security.

Additionally, we have attached a detailed PDF guide that explains the new Family & Pets in Extra features in depth.

This automated message is part of our ongoing effort to keep you informed about critical updates to your account.

Your satisfaction is our top priority, and we appreciate your patience as we resolve these matters.

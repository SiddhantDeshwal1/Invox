Dear Michael Chang,

I am writing to provide you with an important update regarding Licenses in the Security sector. We have recently reviewed our policies and have made some significant changes that may affect you.

We are committed to transparency and will keep you informed of any further developments regarding this case.

In the event of any discrepancies, please report them within 24 hours so that we can launch an immediate investigation.

Additionally, we have attached a detailed PDF guide that explains the new Licenses in Security features in depth.

Our records indicate that your account is in good standing, but we recommend a periodic review of your settings.

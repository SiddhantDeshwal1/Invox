Dear Charles Harris,

I am writing to provide you with an important update regarding Dating in the Social sector. We have recently reviewed our policies and have made some significant changes that may affect you.

We understand that this may cause some inconvenience, but it is a necessary step to ensure the integrity of our Social operations.

Please note that due to recent policy updates, some of the standard procedures for Dating in Social might have changed slightly since your last interaction.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and thank you for your understanding as we upgrade our systems.

Your satisfaction is our top priority, and we appreciate your patience as we resolve these matters.
